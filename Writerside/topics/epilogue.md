# Epilogue

If you decide to stick to and use Serpenta, I wish for the following:

-   migrate to [Svelte 5](https://svelte.dev/blog/svelte-5-release-candidate)
-   migrate to [Tauri v2](https://v2.tauri.app/blog/tauri-2-0-0-release-candidate/)
-   maintain this repository and create your own standard
-   keep this open-source
-   consider migrating to Deno or Bun instead of Node

No matter if you do or not, I wish for the following as well:

-   Design and architecture your software architecture well
-   Write similar documentation for your code base (using
    [Writerside](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/writerside/discover-writerside.html), for example)
-   Promote the delivery of quality information along the DH generations!

Godspeed, DH09! â€” Kiril, the DH08 SenseCon team and DH08 itself.
