# Contributing &amp; Maintenance

The Serpenta Standard is not to be left unattained or especially considered dogmatic. I (Kiril from DH08) leave
as a responsibility for the next generations to maintain it or update it the way they desire. This document will
give you tips on how to do exactly this - maintaining and developing Serpenta itself.

If you are an outside developer and wish to contribute to this open-source standard, first of all, thank you so
much. This document will guide you through the steps needed to contribute to Serpenta.
