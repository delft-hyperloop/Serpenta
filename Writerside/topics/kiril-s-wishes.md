# Epilogue

If you decide to stick to and use Serpenta, I wish for the following:
- migrate to [Svelte 5](https://svelte.dev/blog/svelte-5-release-candidate)
- migrate to [Tauri v2](https://v2.tauri.app/blog/tauri-2-0-0-release-candidate/)
- maintain this repository and create your own standard
- keep this open-source
- consider migrating to Deno or Bun instead of Node

Godspeed, DH09!
