# Tauri Starter Kit Provided

<primary-label ref="tauri-starter-kit" />

Because a lot of the Serpenta functionality is set up entirely in the backend of the app,
with a frontend being a listener. 
As mentioned earlier in the [Tauri Starter Kit article](Tauri-Starter-Kit.md), a UI kit alone won't suffice
to get you started quickly.  

Therefore, we provide a Tauri starter kit that is set up mostly the way the original DH08 GUI is.

The child topics of this section will document the features provided by the starter Tauri kit.
