# Safety Features

To ensure safe operation and compliance with industry standards, Serpenta prepares a set of features that will improve 
observability, error alerting and immediate control. 
These include:
- toast-like alerts and notifications
- highlighting of datatypes with abnormal values
- highlighting of stale data (not updated for a configured period of time)
- procedures list
- key-bind shortcut engine
- multi-window engine

All of the above except for the multi-window engine were required by the 2024 EHW scruteneering committee. 
The demonstrated solutions (now part of Serpenta) were approved and passed all necessary requirements imposed.

Browse the child topics of this article to learn more about each of them and where do they exist within the codebase.

> As you can probably guess, these safety requirements are open to changes, and one must follow them thoroughly and 
adapt their project to the new ones.
