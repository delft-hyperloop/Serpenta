# Safety Features

To ensure safe operation and compliance with industry standards, Serpenta prepares a set of features that will improve
observability, error alerting and immediate control.

> Keep in mind that some safety features are part of the UI kit (as required interfaces), while others (e.g., 
> shortcut engine) are entirely situated in the Tauri Starter Kit.

These include:

- toast-like alerts and notifications _(part of Tauri Starter Kit)_
- highlighting of datatypes with abnormal values
- highlighting of stale data _(not updated for a configured period of time)_
- procedures list _(part of Tauri Starter Kit)_
- key-bind shortcut engine _(part of Tauri Starter Kit)_
- multi-window engine _(required by Serpenta)_

All of the above except for the multi-window engine were required by the 2024 EHW scruteneering committee.
The demonstrated solutions (now part of Serpenta) were approved and passed all necessary requirements imposed.

Browse the child topics of this article to learn more about each of them and where they exist within the codebase.

> As you can probably guess, these safety requirements are open to changes, and one must follow them thoroughly and
> adapt their project to the new ones.
