# Serpenta

This repository holds the packages for the Serpenta GUI, together with the documenttation of how it works, how to modify
it, how to extend it without modifying the package itself, how to make use of the provided components and how to write
your own `GrandDataDistributor`, `GrandCharter` etc.

P.S. Andreas don't worry, these is only for the ui components and such, old config will still remain with the previous
one.
